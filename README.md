# LIODEN PROFILE CSS - [CALEDFWLCH](https://www.lioden.com/territory.php?id=569262)
i'll keep it all to the profile box (probably) just because i don't want it to feel like it stopped being Lioden, so all the changes are just going to be in a box.

I have nothing but my sorrow and I want nothing more. 
It has been, it still is, faithful to me.

Why should I begrudge it, 
since during the hours when my soul
crushed the depths of my heart, 
it was seated there beside me?

O sorrow, I have ended, you see, 
by respecting you, because I am certain 
you will never leave me.

Ah! I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being. 
You are like those who never left
the sad fireside corner of my poor black heart.

O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved: 
because I know that on the day of my final agony, 
you will be there, lying in my sheets,
O sorrow, so that you might once again
attempt to enter my heart.
